# deno-masto
An experimental Deno implementation of Masto.js

## Current status
Under the `src/` directory, there are several useful source codes which have been ported from Masto.js and modified to work with Deno, but `Masto` class and other major features of Masto.js is not ported yet.

This is because currently, we don't have enough toolchain to develop Deno module with editor integrations (yes we have deno/vscode_deno, but it's not stable yet and has limitation) so I felt it is hard to continue developing at this moment.

However, in the future when it becomes easier to do things with Deno, I will surely release the usable version of deno-masto. So please wait for it (or contribute to Deno to make it earlier). I just considered it is premature for now.
